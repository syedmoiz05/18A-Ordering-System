# Restaurant Order and Appointment System
This project is a Java application I built for my class to simulate a restaurant order and appointment scheduling system. I wanted to combine everything we've learned which includes object-oriented programming, arrays, loops, file I/O and I even tried my best at using Swing for a simple UI. Working on this project has been both challenging and super rewarding. Itâ€™s cool to see how the pieces come together to form a working application.
## What It Does
**Order Placement:** Lets users pick from a menu and enter the quantity.

**Appointment Scheduling:** Users can set a delivery appointment by providing a date and time.

**Order Summary:** Displays a summary on screen and writes the details to a text file.

**Swing UI:** Offers a basic UI for a friendlier and more simple experience.

## How to Run It
**Clone or Download:** Get the source code from this repository.

 **Compile:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run: javac *.java
 
 **Run the Program:** Then execute: java RestaurantOrderSystem

 ## Documentation
Along with the source code, you'll find documentation and pseudocode that explain the design and flow of the program from initializing variables and arrays to handling user input and writing the order summary to a file
